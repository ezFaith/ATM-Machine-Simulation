# 🏦 ATM Machine Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a Python-based **ATM Machine Simulation** that replicates essential banking functionalities. The project was developed as part of my **Python Development Internship** at **OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd**. It allows users to perform transactions like **balance inquiries, withdrawals, deposits, PIN changes, and transaction history tracking.**

## 🔹 Features
✅ **Account Balance Inquiry** – Check real-time balance.  
✅ **Cash Withdrawal** – Withdraw funds with validation.  
✅ **Cash Deposit** – Add funds securely.  
✅ **PIN Change** – Update account PIN securely.  
✅ **Transaction History** – View detailed records of transactions.  
✅ **Secure Authentication** – Limits incorrect PIN attempts to prevent unauthorized access.  

## 💡 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Concepts Used:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Input Validation, Error Handling
- **Modules:** `datetime` (for timestamping transactions)

## 📜 How to Run the Project
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ATM-Machine-Simulation.git
 cd ATM-Machine-Simulation
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Python Script
```sh
 python atm_simulation.py
```

### 3️⃣ Follow On-Screen Instructions
- Enter the correct **PIN** to log in.
- Choose an option (Check Balance, Withdraw, Deposit, Change PIN, View Transactions, or Exit).
- Perform transactions securely.

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)
_Add screenshots or a demo GIF of your project in action._
